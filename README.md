# GEO Targeting Demo

This is a simple HTML and JavaScript demo that simulates GEO targeting.

The page changes its content based on the country selected by the user.  
This demonstrates how websites can personalize content for different regions.

## Features
- Country selection dropdown
- Dynamic content based on selected location
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

## How it differs from real GEO
- This demo uses **manual selection** instead of automatic IP detection.
- Production GEO uses APIs or tools (e.g., MaxMind, IPinfo) to detect location automatically.
- Real systems change currency, language, pricing, and offers based on location.
